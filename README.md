# Meme Generator 🎨

This project is a **Meme Generator** built using **React**, showcasing my growing knowledge of React fundamentals. While it might not be the most impressive project, it's a meaningful step in my learning journey. 🌱



## Demo

## ✨ Features
- Generate random memes by fetching data from an external API.
- Customize meme templates with dynamic state management.
- Explore the basics of React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.



## 🛠️ Built With
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Fetch API**: Used to fetch meme data from `https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes`.



## 📚 React Knowledge Demonstrated
1. **`useState`**: Managing state to update meme templates and user input.
2. **`useEffect`**: Fetching data from an API when the component loads.
3. **API Integration**: Dynamically loading memes from the `Imgflip` API.



## 🚀 How It Works
1. The app fetches meme data from `https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes` when the page loads.
2. Users can click a button to randomly select a meme template.
3. The selected meme is displayed with default or custom text.
4. Some memes may not be working with the template.
